## Shawn Lawson: Poet?

### Goals:

1. Use the text from Shawn's emails to the class as a resource for the body of the poem
2. Generate poems from that text 


#### 1. How it works
 1. Load unique words from Shawn's emails to the class into a vector of strings
 2. Choose anywhere from 2 to 10 words from the vector
 3. Put those words together and see how poetic Shawn's writing is 


#### 2. Issues
 The origional idea was to create a particle system where words would collide to create sentences of the poem.  When that didn't work very well I went with this.


#### 3. What I would change 
 I would probally have used a collision system like Box2D instead of just using a particle system.
